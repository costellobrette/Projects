## Netflix Analysis

The data within the files contained in the Netflix Analysis folder were provided by my family's Netflix account. I have included the staging and data loading processes, along with the finsished database created in SQL Server Management Studio. The Power BI presentation is an analysis that shows similarites and differences we share between all profiles in regards to our taste in Netflix content and watching patterns.
